# General model
People wander around and gather as much grain as possible. They attempt to move to the direction where there is the most grain. Every tick, they eat a certain amount of grain (metabolism). Die when they run out of life expectancy or grain. When they die, they produce a single offspring with a random metabolism and random amount of grain (range poorest to richest)/
